# mtag

`mtag` is a TUI to turn audio files into an album.
Run it on a folder of audio files and it will create a subfolder called `tagged/` which you can, for example, directly drag into Apple Music.
It'll also cache the metadata in `album.toml` which allows you to easily fix mistakes by rerunning `mtag`.
